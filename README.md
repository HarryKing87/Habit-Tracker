# Habitify ✏️

For my revision after finishing the second year of my degree, I decided to work with a quick idea that came to my mind before thinking the project. Habitify is a 
habit tracking page that helps the user have knowledge on what they did during the day, month or even year with the help of localStorage and even printed pages 
(including PDF). 

## Use 👨🏻‍💻

Users can easily choose between different buttons regarding three different types of activities (Health, Beauty and Sport) and log their habit times. They can also
open the slider navigation and delete the saved habits from different timeframes or even print the whole page of the day if they wish.
